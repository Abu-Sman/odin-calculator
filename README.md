# odin-calculator

A simple, fully functional calculator built as part of The Odin Project – Foundations Course.
This project focuses on JavaScript logic, state management, and DOM manipulation rather than advanced styling.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic: +, -, \*, /
- Supports chained operations (e.g., 12 + 7 - 1)
- Clear (C) button to reset
- Keyboard support: digits 0–9, operators + - \* /, Enter for equals, Escape for clear
- Prevents invalid operations and handles division by zero
- Rounds long decimals to prevent overflow

## What I Learned

- Managing application state in a UI project
- Evaluating one operation at a time
- Handling edge cases: consecutive operators, starting new calculation after equals
  -Writing modular JS functions
- Adding keyboard accessibility

## Built With

- HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
